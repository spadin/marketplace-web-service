Amazon Marketplace Web Service Wrapper (MWS)
============================================

Experimental project. Trying to simplify using the Amazon MWS which is probably 
one of the worst implemented APIs. This won't look pretty.

**Usage:**

Add to Gemfile

    gem 'marketplacewebservice', :git => "git://github.com/spadin/marketplace-web-service.git"
    
then 

    $ bundle install
